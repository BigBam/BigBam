### hello world ðŸ‘‹
My name is Bam! For over 10 years, I've been working as an iOS developer using Swift & Objective-C. I've worked with all kinds of businesses from start-ups to Fortune 500 companies.
<br>
<br>
In this space, I plan on contributing to all kinds of projects, although recently I've been mainly focusing on learning new technologies and expanding my skillset.

  Here are some things that I've worked on over the years:
  - We have an automated web crawling system using our **Node.js** application, and created a schedule for the crawls using **CloudFormation** to build the stacks.
  - Refactored the frontend by using **Amplify (Next.js)**. I learned so much about **React** by working with this project!
  - I got a chance to use some AWS products. We created AWS Lambda functions using **Python** and linked them to the API Gateway. This was our first version of the REST API and my first true introduction to Python.
  - Then I refactored the aforementioned REST API by using **Express**.
  - Added a chatbot endpoint to the API using **OpenAI**'s library. It's called **PepperChatâ„¢**, you can try it out now!
