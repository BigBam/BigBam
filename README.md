### hello world ðŸ‘‹
My name is Bam! For over 10 years, I've been working as an iOS developer using Swift & Objective-C. I've worked with all kinds of businesses from start-ups to Fortune 500 companies (see my [resume](https://bigbam.github.io/bam.guide/resume/)).
<br>
<br>
In this space, I plan on contributing to all kinds of projects, although recently I've been mainly focusing on learning new technologies and expanding my skillset.

- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about **hiihat.com** ! Hiihat is a social space that empowers the Black community.

  Hiihat is still under construction but we've been developing some cool things since 2020.
  <br>
  Here are some things that I've worked on over the years:
  - We have an automated web crawling system using our **Node.js** application, and created a schedule for the crawls using **CloudFormation** to build the stacks.
  - Refactored the frontend by using **Amplify (Next.js)**. I learned so much about **React** by working with this project!
  - I got a chance to use some AWS products. We created AWS Lambda functions using **Python** and linked them to the API Gateway. This was our first version of the REST API and my first true introduction to Python.
  - Then I refactored the aforementioned REST API by using **Express**.
  - Added a chatbot endpoint to the API using **OpenAI**'s library. It's called **PepperChatâ„¢**, you can try it out now! 
  <br><br>
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with:
  - **Flask** - I would like to learn more about creating REST APIs in Python using the Flask framework.
  - **Capacitor / Ionic** - I'm really curious about building cross-platform mobile apps. I will be adding some repos experimenting with these projects. Can we easily create native apps for iOS and Android by creating Next.js apps and using these cross-platform native runtimes? How is the performance and what are the drawbacks? We will find out !
  <br><br>
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on:
  - Hiihat.com, a search engine for black-owned products, services, news & media.
  - Creating a cross-platform app using a Next.js app as the common codebase (using Capacitor by Ionic).
  - _I have a few other secret projects that will be revealed eventually._
  <br><br>
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning:
  - **Python** - There are so many things to learn, especially data analysis. I'll be adding some repos just to play with a few things.
  - **Typescript** - I want to learn Typescript because I'm curious about visual editors like **Codux**. This could be great for the future of building with React.
  - **React & React Native** - I'm becoming more proficient with React, and I really want to feel more comfortable building things faster and also understanding the best practices for very large projects.
  - **UX/UI Design** - I would really like to get better at using tools like **Figma**, so that I work better with designers. A fun side project would be to design all of the screens for one of the million mobile app ideas that come to me. Also, Figma has some interesting tools and extensions for developers. It's definitely worth exploring.

- âš¡ Fun fact:
  <br>
  - Most friends call me Bam but my full name is Bamidele, which is a Yoruba name given to a child born in a foreign land.
  The literal translation means "follow me home". My father gave me this name as to say that one day this child (me) will follow him to our homeland Nigeria.
  - I was a hammer thrower for the Northeastern University Track & Field team from 2005-2009. One day, Nova ScienceNow filmed me throwing hammer into a field. That clip was featured in their PBS Dark Matter special in which **Neil deGrasse Tyson** narrated over my clip to explain gravity and dark matter ! He referred to me as a "big, strong guy".
